Let me write you a review of the Brita bottle in the form of story. I don’t know why, but I want to.

**TL;DR**
Brita bottle provide a consistent tasting to water. It’s cheap and durable enough for a college student.
 
It was late August when Sean heard he was cut from the college’s varsity soccer team. Sean had played in the state championship TWICE. He left his family in the city to move to a school in the middle of farms, where the air reeked with the smell of manure. On the third floor of an old dorm room filled with asbestos he stood there in fear. He was afraid because as freshmen he realized he didn’t have his family, or any friends. He was afraid because everything around him was different. The people, sounds, his bed, and even the water were all different from what he grew up with. In the old dorm there were no water fountains you had to go to bathroom to get water. The water had a distinct taste of farm runoff mixed with copper piping. From playing soccer he developed the habit of drinking 10 bottles of water every day. So when he went back to school shopping he decided he wouldn’t by crates of water like the other hopeless freshmen. He needed a water bottle, something reusable and durable for his hustling around campus.

Something on the shelf caught his eye, it was a Brita water bottle. A magical product that took the water from the bathroom sink and made it taste like home.  In the coming years whether he would be in visiting his brother in the marines, relaxing at a park in Atlanta, skiing in the mountains of Montreal, or interviewing in San Jose the Brita bottle made all the water taste the same and familiar. No matter where he was in the world water would now be consistent and something he could depend on. At school, his numerous trips to the bathroom got him acquainted with his colleagues in the dorm. They were also filling up their Brita bottles at the sink. All of a sudden everyone was friendly face. They were going out to eat together, exploring the nature around them together, and taking trips weekend trips across the state together. Sean was always happy, he found that his new friend loved soccer as much as him. Every day he would grab a group of eight people to play pickup. Of course he would bring his plastic clad Brita bottle with him.  He would dribble down to the field, throw the bottle by the goal post, and high five all of his friends. They would play till dark. They would all watch the beautiful view of acres of farmland. Meanwhile they would squeeze the Brita bottle into their smiling mouths gasping for air.
