After 3 years of writing on wordpress I have finally upgraded. Goodbye slowness, and good riddance to out-of-date wordpress. This time I made sure the website is typographically appealing. So it's easy on the eyes and easy to read.  Unfortunately I have lost my old posts. Don't start crying just yet, because this will give me a chance to fill your hearts with shiny new posts.

I love technology, the science behind it, and the designs its inspired. So stay tuned for my notes on design, development, and science.

I’m a big fan of entrepreneurship; you’ll probably see stuff about that too.
