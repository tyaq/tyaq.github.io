After 3 years of blogging on wordpress I have finally upgraded. Goodbye slowness, and good riddance out-of-date wordpress. This time I made sure to make it typographically applying. Easy on the eyes and easy to read.  Unfortunately I have lost my old posts. Never fear! I will your hearts with shiny new words. I love technology, particularly the science behind it and the designs that empower us. Stay tuned for more notes on design, development, and science from me.

I’m a big fan of entrepreneurship; you’ll probably see stuff about that too.
