My name is Ish Habib I am a graduating senior physics and mathematics major at SUNY Geneseo. I am passionate about business and technology. I study entrepreneurship, software development trends, design theory, economics, modeling techniques, and... anything that is at this intersection.

Last year I was awarded seed funding to build a toilet training system for children with autism. Before that I performed statistical analysis for the college, and before that I conducted reaserch studying the dissolution rate of young stellar clusters (in laymenâ€™s terms, studying how the universe ages).
